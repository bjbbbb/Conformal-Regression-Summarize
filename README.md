### A Review and Comparative Analysis of Univariate Conformal Regression Methods

We compared eight different conformal prediction methods and provided a summary and analysis of the results. Regarding the code for the results, please refer to: 

All the code for this experiment comes from the following links:  
[TorchCP](https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/TorchCP),  
[CTI](https://github.com/luo-lorry/CTI), and  
[LCP](https://github.com/LeyingGuan/LCP).  

For the dataset usage instructions, please refer to [CTI](https://github.com/luo-lorry/CTI). We utilized 12 real-world datasets, and here we primarily showcase the visualization process.
